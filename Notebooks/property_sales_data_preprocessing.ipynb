In the NYC market, even the cheapest legitimate properties such as vacant land, foreclosed units, or parking spaces rarely sell below $15,000 in arm’s-length transactions. Additionally, the dataset documentation explicitly states that 0 sales represent transfers without cash consideration, and empirical analysis shows that most non-market or artificial transactions cluster between 0 and 10,000. Setting the cutoff at 15,000 safely removes these non-genuine sales while preserving legitimate low-value transactions, resulting in a cleaner and more reliable target variable for
